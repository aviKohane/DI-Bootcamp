#üåü Exercise 4: Floats
#Recap ‚Äì What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
#Create a list containing the following sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 (don‚Äôt hard-code the sequence).
#Can you think of another way to generate a sequence of floats?

#float stores floating-point values, that is, values that have potential decimal places
#int only stores integral values, that is, whole numbers
#To create a list containing the sequence without hard-coding it, you can use a loop to generate the numbers in the sequence:
sequence1 = []
for i in range(1, 5):
    sequence1.append(i + 0.5)
    sequence1.append(i + 1.0)
    print(sequence1)
#Another way to generate a sequence of floats is :
sequence2 = [x / 2 + 0.5 for x in range(2, 10, 1)]
print(sequence2)

#üåü Exercise 5: For Loop

num_list=[]
for x in range(1,21):
